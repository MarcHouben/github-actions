name: Reusable Deploy
# We want to run this workflow from inside other workflows
# The location and version of a reusable workflow file to run as a job, of the form 
# './{path/to}/{localfile}.yml' or '{owner}/{repo}/{path}/{filename}@{ref}'. 
# {ref} can be a SHA, a release tag, or a branch name. Using the commit SHA is the 
# safest for stability and security.
